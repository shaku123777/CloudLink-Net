These games often promote family bonding and mental skill development. Card games, which include games like Uno and poker, are also in demand for their versatility, portability, and ease of play. Their popularity is driven by the growing trend of casual gaming. On the other hand, puzzle games such as jigsaw puzzles and brain teasers are gaining traction, particularly among those who value problem-solving and cognitive challenges. This category has seen innovation with 3D puzzles and interactive digital puzzles that appeal to a tech-savvy audience, broadening the appeal of traditional puzzle formats.<p>Another segment of the market includes educational games and toys designed to enhance cognitive skills in children, such as STEM-based games, word games, and logic puzzles.
